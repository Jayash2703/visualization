       " <span>Fire-Boltt Phoenix BSW 194: Budget-Friendly Fitness on Your Wrist<br/>The Fire-Boltt Phoenix BSW 194 is a smartwatch aimed at those looking for a feature-packed wearable at an affordable price. Let's see if it lives up to the hype.<br/>Design and Build:<br/> * The Phoenix boasts a  1.43-inch AMOLED display with a decent resolution, offering clear visuals.<br/> * The metal body feels surprisingly sturdy for the price, and the IP67 water resistance allows you to take it for runs or wear it in the rain.<br/> * While some reviewers find the design sporty and functional, others might  consider it a bit bulky.<br/>Features:<br/> * The standout feature is Bluetooth calling, which lets you make and receive calls directly from your wrist. This is a convenience you won't find in many smartwatches at this price point.<br/> * Beyond calls, it offers a suite of health and fitness trackers, including heart rate monitoring, SpO2 (blood oxygen) measurement, and multiple sports modes.<br/> * Sleep monitoring and stress monitoring are included as well, although their accuracy might be debated.<br/>Battery Life:<br/> * The Fire-Boltt Phoenix is advertised to last up to 5 days on a single charge, which is fairly standard. However, frequent use of features like Bluetooth calling can significantly reduce that.<br/>Other Considerations:<br/> * The companion app might not be the most intuitive, and some users report occasional syncing issues.<br/> * While the watch offers a wide variety of watch faces, their quality can be inconsistent.<br/>Overall:<br/>The Fire-Boltt Phoenix BSW 194 is a solid option for budget-minded fitness enthusiasts who prioritize features like Bluetooth calling. The display is good, the build quality is decent, and the health tracking features, while not perfect, are a welcome addition. However, keep in mind the potential drawbacks like a less-than-perfect app and average battery life when making your decision.<br/>Here's a quick breakdown:<br/>Pros:<br/> * Affordable price<br/> * Bluetooth calling<br/> * Multiple health and fitness tracking features<br/> * AMOLED display<br/>Cons:<br/> * Bulky design (subjective)<br/> * App could be improved<br/> * Inconsistent battery life with heavy use<br/>If you're looking for a feature-rich smartwatch at a great price, the Fire-Boltt Phoenix BSW 194 is a strong contender. Just be sure to manage your expectations for app performance and battery life.</span>\n",

       " 'This is a great watch although I can’t get phone or ai voice control to work on the watch, does anyone know what size band this watch takes, I’m trying to find a different color band',\n",

While removing it from the packaging, the display fell off the watch. It is only connected by a few scraps of terrible glue and the ribbon cable. I didn't even get to wear it. I have never returned a product faster. Do not buy this! Even if yours stays together, the glue is so bad that the water and dust ratings are meaningless. Save your money.\",\n",

I look forward to future products from this company and will definitely buy the next model to come out.2 Week Update: Still pretty happy with the watch given the price. My biggest complaint is you can not silence the ringer or put it on vibrate. I ended up just disabling the phone in my phone's Bluetooth settings because it's more of a gimmick anyway.1 Month Update: I found out the hard way this watch leaks like a sieve. I think it's unreasonable for a watch to not have an any water resistance.\"]"
